# XJTU Open Source Security Team 🚀🔐

Welcome to the **XJTU Open Source Security Team** GitHub organization!

We are a team of developers and security researcher from **Xi'an Jiaotong University** (XJTU)🔍, focusing on advancing the field of open-source security. Our team is dedicated to the development of **Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools**, aimed at helping developers and organizations identify and mitigate vulnerabilities within their software components. 🤖🔧

## Key Areas of Focus

- **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** We develop tools to analyze the components and dependencies of software projects to detect vulnerabilities and licensing issues.
  
- **LLM Integration:** We are exploring the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the capabilities of our security tools, improving vulnerability detection, automated suggestions, and more.

## Projects

### 1. **SCA Tool Development**
   - Our team develops open-source tools that scan and analyze software dependencies, helping identify and address security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

### 2. **LLM for Security Enhancements**
   - Leveraging the power of LLMs, we aim to incorporate automated analysis and recommendations into our security tools, making vulnerability management smarter and more efficient.
